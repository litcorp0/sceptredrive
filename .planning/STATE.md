## Repository State

- Fresh git history initialized on `dev` (no commits before the planning commit).
- Working tree contains the new scaffolds: `admin/` (TanStack Start) and `api/` (Hono).
- Nested lockfiles (`admin/bun.lock`, `api/bun.lock`) and `api/pnpm-workspace.yaml` were
  removed so Phase 1 can establish the single root Bun workspace.
- Desktop app, shared packages, PowerSync config, and infrastructure are created in later
  phases (6, 1, 6, and 9 respectively).
- A bundle of the deleted prototype's git history is stored outside the repository at
  `/tmp/opencode/gikautos-old-history.bundle` (safe to delete).

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-17 | The earlier prototype and its planning are discarded; fresh git history on `dev`. |
| 2026-10-17 | v1 scope: POS + back office + inventory + suppliers + credit + loyalty + Paystack. E-commerce, delivery, payroll, GL, AI, fitment, and mobile are out of scope. |
| 2026-10-17 | API: Hono + Drizzle + Better Auth on Node 24. |
| 2026-10-17 | Offline sync: PowerSync Cloud (Free → Pro), Web SDK in the Electron renderer. |
| 2026-10-17 | Database: PostgreSQL 17 on a VPS via Docker; PowerSync Cloud connects over TLS with an IP allowlist. |
| 2026-10-17 | Admin/Manager: TanStack Start. Desktop POS: Electron Forge + Vite + React + shadcn + Tailwind. |
| 2026-10-17 | Ghana GHS; VAT 15% + NHIL 2.5% + GETFund 2.5% = 20%; E-VAT receipt contract now, GRA adapter mock until credentials. |
| 2026-10-17 | Roles: Admin (global), Manager (branch), Cashier (terminal). One cashier per terminal per shift. |
| 2026-10-17 | Credit is branch-local; customer identity and loyalty are global. |
| 2026-10-17 | Offline: cash + credit work; MoMo/card/bank require internet. Never block a sale; oversell, over-limit credit, and loyalty double-spend become reconciliation conflicts. |
| 2026-10-17 | Loyalty: configurable; defaults 1 pt/GHS 1, 100 pts = GHS 1, 12-month expiry. |
| 2026-10-17 | Suppliers: invoices + payments ledger; Paystack transfers + manual fallback. |
| 2026-10-17 | Deployment: one VPS, separate staging/prod Docker stacks, Caddy, GitHub Actions, R2 backups. |
| 2026-10-17 | Scale target: 5 branches, 20 terminals, 5k SKUs, 20k customers. Manual data entry only. |

## Open Items (carry forward)

- GRA E-VAT onboarding: credentials, QR encoding, submission API shape (mock until then).
- Paystack registered business and keys; `PAYSTACK_MODE=mock` until then.
- VPS provider, domain, and DNS (Phase 9 setup gate).
- Windows code-signing certificate (Phase 9; unsigned builds first).
- PowerSync Cloud account + two instances (staging/prod) before Phase 6 human verification.
- Physical hardware for human verification: ESC/POS printer, keyboard-wedge scanner, cash drawer.

---

## Session Notes

- Load `gsd` and `owasp-security` before every planning or building task; load
  `powersync`, `hono`, `better-auth-*`, and `supabase-postgres-best-practices` when the
  task touches those areas.
- Plans are prompts. Implement one task at a time and commit atomically.
- Stop and ask before decisions that affect money, credit, stock, loyalty, permissions,
  or production infrastructure.
